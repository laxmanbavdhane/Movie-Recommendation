            <br> <b><u>How can this website help?</u></b>
            <br> Content-based methods are based on the similarity of movie attributes. Using this type 
            of recommender system, if a user watches one movie, similar movies are recommended. 
            For example, if a user watches a comedy movie starring Adam Sandler, the system will 
            recommend them movies in the same genre or starring the same actor, or both. 
        
           <br> <b><u>What can you find on this website?</u></b>
           <br> To obtain recommendations for our users, we will predict their ratings for movies they haven’t
           watched yet. Movies are then indexed and suggested to users based on these predicted ratings.
           To do this, we will use past records of movies and user ratings to predict their future ratings.
           At this point, it’s worth mentioning that in the real world, we will likely encounter new users 
           or movieswithout a history. Such situations are called cold start problems.
