<h1>1. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3><br>
    <p class="text">
        Both ‘Interstellar’ and ‘Gravity’ took us out of this world, but the
        reputation of Stanley Kubrick’ classic – now re-released – is safe.
        It’s not that ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’ doesn’t look dated – it does, a bit – 
        but it remains as intelligent and provocative as ever, bearing years of
        conceptual dreaming.Until today’s equivalent of novelist Arthur C Clarke
        commits a hefty chunk of time to envisioning the beginning of human civilisation,
        as well as the far future, there will be no new film to supplant it.
        <br>
        Though it was showered with praise for its technical achievements, ‘2001’ lingers 
        more potently in the mind as a tall, black riddle: where are the new bones, the new 
        tools, that will take us higher? Douglas Rain’s clammy voice work as Hal 9000, 
        the murderous machine, remains one of Kubrick’s snazziest pieces of direction.

    <h1>2. The Godfather (1972)</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>Description</h3><br>
    <p class="text">
        An everyday story of Mafia folk, incorporating a severed horse's head in the bed and a number of 
        heartwarming family occasions, as well as pointers on how not to behave in your local trattoria 
        (i.e. blasting the brains of your co-diners out all over their fettuccini).
        <br>

        Mario Puzo's novel was brought to the screen in bravura style by Coppola, who was here trying out 
        for the first time that piano/fortissimo style of crosscutting between religious ritual and bloody
         machine-gun massacre that was later to resurface in a watered-down version in The Cotton Club. See 
         Brando with a mouthful of orange peel.  Watch Pacino's cheek muscles twitch in incipiently psychotic
         fashion. Trace his rise from white sheep of the family to budding don and fully-fledged bad guy. Singalong 
         to Nino Rota's irritatingly catchy theme tune. Its soap operatics should never have been presented 
         separately from Part II.

        <h1>3. Citizen Kane (1941))</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Description</h3><br>
        <p class="text">
            The source book of Orson Welles, and still a marvellous movie. Thematically less resonant than
            some of Welles' later meditations on the nature of power, perhaps, but still absolutely riveting
            as an investigation of a citizen - newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst by any other name - 
            under suspicion of having soured the American Dream. Its imagery (not forgetting the oppressive ceilings) 
            as Welles delightedly explores his mastery of a new vocabulary, still amazes and delights, from 
            the opening shot of the forbidding gates of Xanadu to the last glimpse of the vanishing Rosebud 
            (tarnished, maybe, but still a potent symbol). A film that gets better with each renewed acquaintance.

        <h1>4. Jeanne Dielman, 23, Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Description</h3><br>
        <p class="text">
            Long considered a feminist masterpiece, Chantal Akerman’s quietly ruinous portrait of a widow’s daily 
            routine—her chores slowly yielding to a sense of pent-up frustration—should take its rightful place on 
            any all-time list. This is not merely a niche film, but a window onto a universal condition, depicted 
            in a concentrated structuralist style. More hypnotic than you may realize, Akerman’s uninterrupted 
            takes turn the simple acts of dredging veal or cleaning the bathtub into subtle critiques of moviemaking 
            itself. (Pointedly, we never see the sex work Jeanne schedules in her bedroom to make ends meet.) 
            Lulling us into her routine, Akerman and actor Delphine Seyrig create an extraordinary sense of sympathy 
            rarely matched by other movies. Jeanne Dielman represents a total commitment to a woman’s life, hour by 
            hour, minute by minute. And it even has a twist ending.

        <h3>Description</h3><br>
        <p class="text">
            Starting with a dissolve from the Paramount logo and ending in a warehouse inspired by Citizen Kane, Raiders 
            of the Lost Ark celebrates what movies can do more joyously than any other film. Intricately designed as a 
            tribute to the craft, Steven Spielberg’s funnest blockbuster has it all: rolling boulders, a barroom brawl, a 
            sparky heroine (Karen Allen) who can hold her liquor and lose her temper, a treacherous monkey, a champagne-
            drinking villain (Paul Freeman), snakes (“Why did it have to be snakes?”), cinema’s greatest truck chase and 
            a barnstorming supernatural finale where heads explode. And it’s all topped off by Harrison Ford’s pitch-perfect 
            Indiana Jones, a model of reluctant but resourceful heroism (look at his face when he shoots that swordsman). In 
            short, it’s cinematic perfection.

        <br>
        <h3>Description</h3><br>
        <p class="text">
            Made in the middle of Italy’s boom years, Federico Fellini’s runaway box-office hit came to define heated 
            glamour and celebrity culture for the entire planet. It also made Marcello Mastroianni a star; here, he 
            plays a gossip journalist caught up in the frenzied, freewheeling world of Roman nightlife. Ironically, the 
            movie’s portrayal of this milieu as vapid and soul-corrodingly hedonistic appears to have passed many 
            viewers by. Perhaps that’s because Fellini films everything with so much cinematic verve and wit that it’s 
            often hard not to get caught up in the delirious happenings onscreen. So much of how we view fame still dates 
            back to this film; it even gave us the word paparazzi.

        <h1>7. Seven Samurai (1954)</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Description</h3><br>
        <p class="text">
            It’s the easiest 207 minutes of cinema you’ll ever sit through. On the simplest of frameworks—a poor farming 
            community pools its resources to hire samurai to protect them from the brutal bandits who steal its 
            harvest—Akira Kurosawa mounts a finely drawn epic, by turns absorbing, funny and exciting. Of course the 
            action sequences stir the blood—the final showdown in the rain is unforgettable—but this is really a 
            study in human strengths and foibles. Toshiro Mifune is superb as the half-crazed self-styled samurai, 
            but it’s Takashi Shimura’s Yoda-like leader who gives the film its emotional center. Since replayed in 
            the Wild West (The Magnificent Seven), in space (Battle Beyond the Stars) and even with animated insects 
            (A Bug’s Life), the original still reigns supreme.

        <br>
        <h3>Description</h3><br>
        <p class="text">
            Can a film really be an instant classic? Anyone who watched In The Mood for Love when it was released in 
            2000 may have said yes. The second this love story opens, you sense you are in the hands of a master. 
            Wong Kar-wai guides us through the narrow streets and stairs of ’60s Hong Kong and into the lives of 
            two neighbors (Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung) who discover their spouses are having an affair. As they 
            imagine—and partly reenact—how their partners might be behaving, they fall for each other while remaining 
            determined to respect their wedding vows. Loaded with longing, the film benefits from no less than 
            three cinematographers, who together create an intense sense of intimacy, while the faultless performances 
            shiver with sexual tension. This is cinema.

        <h3>Description</h3><br>
        <p class="text">
            On the road to becoming the most significant filmmaker of the last 20 years, Paul Thomas Anderson 
            transformed from a Scorsesian chronicler of debauched L.A. life into a hard-nosed investigator of the 
            American confidence man. The pivotal point was There Will Be Blood, an epic about a certain kind of 
            hustler—the oil baron and prospector. Daniel Plainview is, in the final analysis, an ultra-scary Daniel Day-
            Lewis who will drink your milkshake. Scored by Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood (himself emerging as a major composer),
             Anderson’s mournful epic is the true heir to Chinatown’s bone-deep cynicism. As Phantom Thread makes clear, 
             Anderson hasn’t lost his sense of humor, not by a long shot. But there once was a moment when he needed to 
             get serious, and this is it

            <p class="text">
                Christopher Nolan’s brooding, expansive Batman sequel fuses the comic-book flick with the crime epic, and
                 delivers something truly special: a pop spectacle with passages of surprisingly potent despair. The film’s 
                 runaway box-office success, along with its critical acclaim, made it a phenomenon that reshaped Hollywood. 
                 There’s a reason why superhero movies are taken so seriously nowadays—even by the Oscars—and this is basically 
                 it.
